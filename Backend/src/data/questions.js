    { scenario: "You are a member of a study group and you observe members of your group having a heated conversation. Mike and John are confronting Sarah about her inconsistent contribution to the study group. Mike and John are upset that Sarah did not contribute to the study session today and accuse her of not being prepared. Sarah defends herself by saying that she has been busy writing an important paper. Mike and John inform her that they also had the same paper due and, despite that, were able to show up prepared for the session. They then accuse her of regularly coming to tutorials unprepared, suggesting that she’s only learning from the information that they have provided during the study sessions. Sarah informs them that she has been under a lot of stress and that they are not being fair to her. She prepares to leave due to their “negativity”. ",
         question1: "1. You are a member of the study group and have not participated in the interaction so far, but now the group is looking to you. How would you diffuse this situation?", 
         answer1: "My primary concern is diffusing the tension while maintaining collegiality within the group and moving toward successful completion of our coursework. Firstly, I will actively listen to both sides to promote understanding and ask probing questions to understand everyone’s perspectives and priorities. I will speak to each member privately. I would validate Mike and John’s frustrations about feeling that Sarah doesn’t come prepared; but I would also validate Sarah’s feelings around being occupied with other material. Sarah has also indicated that she has been under a lot of stress, so I want to understand what’s happening. If this is the case, I would help her identify any barriers which may be impeding her ability to prepare for these sessions. Based on the information provided, I would refer her to campus resources for support, if appropriate. After speaking with all parties, I would help reset group expectations by reaffirming our goals, expectations, and roles within the group, while also fostering a collegial environment. After everyone’s expectations are recognized, I would follow up with my colleagues at our next study session to ensure we are all on track. As well, I would again speak with Sarah privately to check in on her overall wellbeing. ", 
         question2: "2. Do you agree with the two students who are upset with Sarah? Why or why not?",
         answer2: "As mentioned above, I can understand where the two male students’ frustrations are stemming from. Their feelings need to be validated, but as stated above, both the perspectives of Sarah and the male students needs to be explored and shared with each other. If Sarah has indeed not been preparing for the sessions, and this was not due to extenuating circumstances, then I would agree with the two male students’ feelings, because everyone needs to contribute equally. However, it is important to obtain Sarah’s perspective and to help her overcome barriers which are hindering her contribution.", 
         question3: "3. What suggestions can you make to help the group function better going forward?",
         answer3: "As mentioned above, airing of grievances is important followed by establishing clear expectations. Allowing all parties to air grievances, and making space for other members to defend themselves, gives everyone an equal opportunity to share their perspective. Setting expectations allows everyone to be aware of minimum requirements to be part of the group. Such expectations can be determined collectively. Finally, exploring barriers that are hindering group members from participating is in everyone’s favor and should be pursued as a group. Once barriers are identified, then strategies to overcome these barriers can be implemented. If at any time I felt as though professional support or advice would be beneficial, I would reach out to our professor, TA, or other authority.  ",

    { scenario: "You are sitting in on a conversation between Tom and Jessie, two of your co-workers at an energy firm. Tom informs Jessie that he is having a tough time with a personal decision: he and his wife are expecting a child, and his wife would like him to take paternity leave with her. He tells Jessie that the company is taking on a new project that he would lead and doing well on this project could significantly advance his career. Despite his excitement for parenthood, he is struggling between spending time with his family in the short-term vs. focusing on his career, which would ultimately benefit his family in the long-term. He feels that if he misses this work opportunity, he will not get a similar chance for a few years. Additionally, claiming that the industry is largely “male-dominated,” he feels that his boss would not be understanding if he requested paternity leave; he even recalls a time in the past when a male colleague who took paternity leave was penalized by being kept in the same position for years upon his return to work. Jessie turns to you and asks, “What do you think he should do?”",
         question1: "1. Would you recommend he take paternity leave? Why or why not?", 
         answer1: "This is a challenging and sensitive situation. Tom feels like he must choose between his career and spending time with his partner and newborn child. First, I would like to know the company’s policy regarding paternity leave, so I would consult Human Resources (HR) and I would encourage Tom to speak with both HR and his boss to understand their perspective on paternity leave. I would also have a private and non-judgmental conversation with Tom, to discuss his priorities. Does he prioritize spending time with his family, or does he prioritize his career in terms of a speedy trajectory to promotion? If he feels strongly about spending time with his partner and newborn, I would encourage him to spend time with his family. If he feels that prioritizing his career for the best interest of providing for his family and that sacrificing spending time with his wife and newborn is acceptable, then I would support his decision. Ultimately, the one with the most insight would be Tom and I would help guide his decision. Information collected about the company would help inform Tom of the potential consequences of taking paternity leave based on whether the company is supportive or unsupportive of it. That said, I would encourage Tom not to rely on hearsay regarding his other colleague’s supposed punishment for taking paternity leave. ", 
         question2: "2. What strategies could you offer to help him make a decision that he feels comfortable with?", 
         answer2: "As stated above, I would encourage him to gather concrete information about the company and their policy and culture around paternity leave. He would be able to do this by speaking with human resources, with his boss, and with colleagues who have taken (or given up) paternity leave. This will help inform his decision with regards to impact on his job projection and promotion. Then, I would brainstorm with Tom around his current priorities and what sacrifices he is willing to take to fulfil his goals. The decision would be whether to take paternity leave to prioritize spending time with his wife and newborn while potentially delaying career progression vs. not taking paternity leave, sacrificing spending time with his wife and newborn. This is a personal decision, and I would support Tom by making sure he makes an informed decision. ", 
         question3: "3. Maintaining work-life balance can be challenging. Why do you think people struggle to find balance?", 
         answer3: "Work-life balance is often defined as time allocated to one’s career vs. time allocated to other personal aspects of one’s life, such as family, recreation, and self-care. The assumption is that work requires energy expenditure and life activities recharge one’s energy. There are many reasons why individuals struggle with maintaining an acceptable work-life balance, including having a demanding job, poor time management or scheduling skills, unrealistic expectations by employers, and financial pressures. One unique challenge of the present era is also the expectation that employees are effectively “on call” at all hours. As well, employers bear some responsibility here, and should be mindful of the time demands they place on employees. It is important for individuals to identify the specific reasons behind their personal situation and try to have a more balanced approach to life.  ",

    { scenario: "You are sitting in a meeting with Frank and Julia, two of your co-workers at a financial firm. Frank wants to talk about a member of his team, Jason, with regards to some concerning behavior of late. Frank is concerned that Jason has been showing up late to work and has been seen dozing off during meetings. Despite this behavior, the team’s overall performance has been very positive. Julia weighs in on the conversation, saying that our company encourages flexible working conditions, where employees can maintain their own schedules as long as they maintain good performance with positive reviews. Frank further elaborates that Jason has been acting a little distant of late and avoiding any personal questions about his family; he’s worried that this behavior could be a sign of something more serious. While Julia seems concerned by this disclosure, she informs Frank that, as long as Jason has not shared any specific struggles with Frank, it would be a transgression of boundaries to approach Jason about personal matters.",
        question1: "1. What advice would you give to Frank about his team member, Jason?", 
        answer1: "I would be concerned about the well-being of my co-worker’s team member. I would inform him that it sounds like his team member might be experiencing personal problems, which may be impacting his behavior and potentially his mental health. It may also be that Jason’s job satisfaction has declined recently, leading him to distance himself somewhat from his work and co-workers. However, I would caution against making assumptions and encourage Frank to speak with Jason in a private and non-judgmental manner. I would suggest that he share his concerns with Jason and give him an opportunity to share any personal struggles with him if he is comfortable doing so. There could be alternative explanations for his recent behavior, such as a new and/or untreated medical condition, in conjunction with trying to maintain a semblance of privacy. If his team member is experiencing personal problems at home, Frank can offer him support and refer him to counselling. In any case, it is important to address the issue for Jason’s sake, in the interest of his own well-being, and to help him see that he is supported by his team. ", 
        question2: "2. Do you agree that taking any additional action in this situation would be considered “overstepping boundaries”? Why or why not?", 
        answer2: "In this scenario, it would depend on intent and approach. If the intent of probing for more information is mere curiosity, it would be considered “overstepping boundaries”. However, if the intent of probing for more information is to ensure the safety and well-being of the team member, then no, I would not consider this “overstepping boundaries”. Additionally, the setting and method of approach needs to be sensitive to the privacy and comfort of the team member. This conversation should take place in a private setting and be confidentiality maintained. While the lines of such boundaries can be complex, when a team member’s mental or physical health or well-being may be at stake, a careful and sensitive approach is better than disinterest or apathy. ", 
        question3: "3. Imagine you heard rumors that Jason was being bullied at work, would this change your reaction to the situation? Explain your response.", 
        answer3: "It would not change my approach to the situation. I would start by gathering more information, since I cannot act on rumors. I would meet directly with Jason in a private setting and speak with him in a non-judgmental and non-confrontational manner. I would also inform him that all information discussed would be confidential and demonstrate my investment in his well-being through active listening and a compassionate approach. While it is important to address any behavior that creates a negative work environment, my ultimate concern would be Jason’s well-being. As such, in our initial meeting, I would focus on this, and – if necessary – follow up with a full investigation into the bullying allegations. ",
